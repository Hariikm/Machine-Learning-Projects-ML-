ðŸ”· Problem Statement: We have a dataset containing information about different properties in banglore loacation. The dataset includes the following columns:

ðŸ”¸area_type: Describes the type of area the property is located in (e.g., Super built-up Area, Built-up Area, Plot Area, Carpet Area).<br>
ðŸ”¸availability: Indicates the date of property availability<br>
ðŸ”¸location: Specifies the location of the property.<br>
ðŸ”¸size: Represents the size or number of rooms in the property (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK).<br>
ðŸ”¸society: Indicates the name of the society or housing complex the property belongs to.<br>
ðŸ”¸total_sqft: Specifies the total square footage of the property.<br>
ðŸ”¸bath: Represents the number of bathrooms in the property.<br>
ðŸ”¸balcony: Indicates the number of balconies available in the property.<br>
ðŸ”¸price: Represents the price of the property.<br>

<br><br>

ðŸ”· Objective : Our objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a property based on its features.

To address this , we will:

ðŸ”¸Explore and analyze the dataset, understanding the distribution and characteristics of the data.<br>
ðŸ”¸Preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality.<br>
ðŸ”¸Perform feature engineering, transforming and selecting relevant features for the model.<br>
ðŸ”¸Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for regression.<br>
ðŸ”¸Train the model using the dataset, optimizing its parameters if necessary.<br>
ðŸ”¸Evaluate the model's performance using suitable metrics such as mean absolute error or root mean squared error.<br>
ðŸ”¸Utilize the trained model to predict the price of new properties based on their features.<br>
ðŸ”¸The success of our project will be determined by the model's ability to provide accurate price predictions for new properties.<br>

ðŸ”· Basic Data Preprocessing

ðŸ”¸Removed duplicated records and as well as null values from the data frame.<br>
ðŸ”¸Converted the availability columns from a specific date to number of days left for availability.<br>
ðŸ”¸Converted the size column from object datatype into BHK having only numeric values.<br>
ðŸ”¸Deleted the society column as in further analysis it is observed as insignificant.<br>
ðŸ”¸Cleaned the total_sqr column which was having â€˜-â€™, â€˜sqâ€™ etc into only float datatypes.<br>
ðŸ”¸Dropped the only 46 data which were null values left in total_sqft.<br>
ðŸ”¸Filled the null values in Bath and Balcony using Iterative Imputer.<br>
ðŸ”¸Aggregated a total of 1061 locations into the 'Others' category, which encompassed locations with a count of less than 11.<br>
ðŸ”¸Used fuzzywuzzy algorithm to check the similarity between locations and grouped them further<br>

<br><br>

ðŸ”· Advanced Data Processing<br><br>

ðŸ”¸Dropped data points having 0 square feet and also those having less than 250 sqfts per BHK.<br>
ðŸ”¸Dropped data points having bathroom having more than 2 of BHK.<br>
ðŸ”¸Dropped the outliers in price having values more or less than 1.5 times of standard deviation from the mean.<br>
ðŸ”¸Dropped the data points with prices lower than the average price of properties with fewer bedrooms.<br>
ðŸ”¸Dropped data points having BHK greater than 9 because the price of that doesnâ€™t act as usual.<br>

ðŸ”· Finding the Best Model<br><br>

ðŸ”¸From this we identified that XGboost is the best algorithm to build the final model.

<br><br>

ðŸ”· Feature Engineering<br><br>

ðŸ”¸From this we identified that bath, balcony doesnâ€™t got much significance so we drop it.

<br><br>

ðŸ”· Final Model Building<br>
<br>
ðŸ”¸We converted the locations and area _type into dummy variables through one-hot-encoding.<br>
ðŸ”¸We have also did hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV<br>
ðŸ”¸We then build the final model using XGBoost Regressor with the following scores : <br><br>
